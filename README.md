## [Spi Mandlebrot Rendering]
Functionality:

    The chip we developed performs calculations for generating the Mandelbrot fractal using imaginary number generation. It contains a specialized algorithm to efficiently compute the complex mathematical calculations involved in rendering the fractal. If you would like more context as to what is going on behind the scenes here is a link to check out: Mandlebrot Fractal[https://mathigon.org/course/fractals/mandelbrot]

    The microcontroller acts as a control unit, managing the communication between the integrated chip and other components.

    The SPI interface enables data transfer between the microcontroller and the integrated chip. It allows the microcontroller to send configuration parameters and receive calculated data from the chip.


## Pin Layout
Put all the GPIO pin numbers, i/o/io determination, and labels

## Supporting Equipment
List all the required equipment and upload a breadboard with the equipment set up (recommend using tinkercad circuits if possible)

## RTL Diagrams
All the stuff from the proposal goes here, obviously updated from the time you did the proposal to the final layout
Include more than just block diagrams, including sub-block diagrams, state-transition diagrams, flowcharts, and timing diagrams

## Some Legal Statement
From Purdue that I haven't figured out yet, maybe some stuff about Dr. J, the program, and other instructors
